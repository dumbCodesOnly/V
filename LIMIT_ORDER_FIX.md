# Limit Order Logic Fix - Aug 2025

## Issue Identified
Limit orders were executing immediately regardless of price conditions, which is incorrect behavior for real trading.

## Root Cause
The limit order execution logic was not validating whether the limit price made practical sense relative to current market conditions:

- Long limit orders above current market price were executing immediately
- Short limit orders below current market price were executing immediately
- No validation to ensure limit orders are placed in sensible directions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Limit Order Validation
Added validation before execution:

**Long Limit Orders:**
- Must be placed BELOW current market price
- Error returned if limit price > market price
- User guided to use market order or adjust limit price

**Short Limit Orders:**
- Must be placed ABOVE current market price  
- Error returned if limit price < market price
- User guided to use market order or adjust limit price

### 2. Proper Execution Logic
**Long Limit Orders:**
- Only execute when market price drops to or below limit price
- Status remains "pending" until price condition met

**Short Limit Orders:**
- Only execute when market price rises to or above limit price
- Status remains "pending" until price condition met

## Example Scenarios

### Long Limit Order
- Current BTC price: $123,098
- User sets long limit at $120,000 ✅ (below market)
- Order stays pending until BTC drops to $120,000 or lower
- User sets long limit at $128,000 ❌ (above market)
- System returns error: "Use market order or set limit below current price"

### Short Limit Order  
- Current BTC price: $123,098
- User sets short limit at $125,000 ✅ (above market)
- Order stays pending until BTC rises to $125,000 or higher
- User sets short limit at $120,000 ❌ (below market)
- System returns error: "Use market order or set limit above current price"

## Result
Limit orders now behave like real trading platform orders:
- Proper validation prevents nonsensical limit prices
- Orders wait for appropriate market conditions before executing
- Clear error messages guide users to correct usage
- Automated monitoring executes orders when conditions are met
