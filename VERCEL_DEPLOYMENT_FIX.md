# Vercel Live Data Fix

## Problem
Vercel deployment was showing fallback data instead of live Bitcoin prices due to Vercel environment detection.

## Solution 
1. **Remove ALL Vercel-specific fallback logic** from api/app.py
2. **Force live data usage** by eliminating environment-based branching
3. **Test external API access** on Vercel platform

## Files Updated
- `api/app.py` - Removed VERCEL environment fallback systems
- `api/index.py` - Removed VERCEL environment variable setting

## Current Status
- Replit version: Live data working ($119,655)
- Vercel version: Testing if external API calls work without fallback

## Next Deployment
Copy the updated `api/app.py` and `api/index.py` to your repository and redeploy to test if Vercel can access live Binance API data directly.

If Vercel blocks external APIs, we'll need a different approach (proxy service or API forwarding).
