# Fixed Vercel Deployment Guide

## Issue Resolved
The Vercel deployment was returning 404 because the configuration was pointing to the wrong file. This has been fixed:

✅ **Updated `vercel.json`** to point to `api/app.py` (main application) instead of `api/app_streamlined.py`
✅ **Updated `api/index.py`** to import the correct Flask app
✅ **Verified Flask app export** - the app variable is properly available

## Fixed Configuration

### vercel.json
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "api/app.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/webhook",
      "dest": "api/app.py",
      "headers": {
        "Cache-Control": "no-cache"
      }
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "api/app.py"
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    "VERCEL": "1"
  }
}
```

### api/index.py
```python
"""
Vercel serverless function entry point - Main deployment
This imports the full Flask application with all trading bot functionality
"""
# Import the complete Flask application
from .app import app
```

## Next Steps for User

1. **Commit and push** the changes to your Git repository
2. **Redeploy** the Vercel application (it should auto-deploy if connected to Git)
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for the deployment to complete
4. **Test the URL**: https://v0-03-one.vercel.app/

## Expected Result
- The main page should now load the Telegram Mini-App interface
- The webhook endpoint `/webhook` should be accessible
- All API endpoints should work properly

## Environment Variables Needed
Make sure these are set in your Vercel dashboard:
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` - Your bot token
- `SESSION_SECRET` - A secure random string
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL database URL
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN` - Optional security token

The deployment should now work correctly!
