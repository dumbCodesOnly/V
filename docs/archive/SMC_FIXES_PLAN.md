## Issues & Fixes

### ‚úÖ Issue 1: Type Safety in `generate_trade_signal()` Return Type
**Severity:** Critical (117 LSP errors)  
**Location:** `api/smc_analyzer.py` line 1705, `api/app.py` multiple locations

**Problem:**
- Method has conditional return type: `SMCSignal | None` OR `Tuple[SMCSignal | None, Dict]`
- Callers don't check return type, causing type checker errors
- 117 LSP diagnostics flagging attribute access on Union type

**Fix Strategy:**
- Add `@overload` decorators to properly type the method signature
- First overload: `(symbol: str, return_diagnostics: False) -> Optional[SMCSignal]`
- Second overload: `(symbol: str, return_diagnostics: True) -> Tuple[Optional[SMCSignal], Dict]`
- Import `overload` from typing

**Files Modified:**
- `api/smc_analyzer.py` lines 14 (added overload import), 1708-1712 (added overload decorators)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - LSP errors reduced from 117 to 53

---

### ‚úÖ Issue 2: Counter-Trend Logic Inconsistency
**Severity:** High  
**Location:** `api/smc_analyzer.py` lines 1282-1320, 1944-1976

**Problem:**
- RSI conditions checked in hybrid logic (lines 1282-1320) to GENERATE signal
- Same conditions checked again in rejection logic (lines 1957-1966) to ADD rejection reasons
- Signal can exist with rejection reasons attached (confusing diagnostics)

**Fix Strategy:**
- Remove duplicate RSI/sweep validation from rejection logic (lines 1957-1966)
- Keep only the validation in hybrid logic where signals are generated
- Ensures rejection reasons only appear when NO signal is generated

**Files to Modify:**
- `api/smc_analyzer.py` lines 1957-1966

**Status:** ‚è≥ Pending

---

### ‚úÖ Issue 3: Confidence Score Triple Counting
**Severity:** High  
**Location:** `api/smc_analyzer.py` lines 1287-1292, 1336-1352, 2014-2046

**Problem:**
- Same evidence (liquidity sweeps, OBs, FVGs) counted 3 times:
  1. Hybrid logic: +0.2 sweep bonus (line 1290)
  2. Trade metrics: +0.2 sweeps, +0.1 OBs, +0.1 FVGs (lines 1337-1349)
  3. Signal strength: Additional bonuses (lines 2014-2046)
- Confidence artificially inflated from 0.4 ‚Üí 0.9+

**Fix Strategy:**
- Keep Phase 3 enhanced confidence calculation (most comprehensive)
- Remove duplicate bonuses from hybrid logic (lines 1287-1292)
- Remove duplicate bonuses from trade metrics (lines 1336-1352)
- Ensure each factor counted ONCE in Phase 3 method

**Files to Modify:**
- `api/smc_analyzer.py` lines 1287-1292 (remove sweep bonus)
- `api/smc_analyzer.py` lines 1336-1352 (simplify, remove duplicate bonuses)

**Status:** ‚è≥ Pending

---

### ‚úÖ Issue 4: RSI Threshold Misalignment
**Severity:** Medium  
**Location:** `api/smc_analyzer.py` lines 1285, 1305, 1958, 1963

**Problem:**
- Current: RSI < 35 for longs, > 65 for shorts
- Standard SMC: RSI < 30 (oversold), > 70 (overbought)
- Less extreme thresholds may generate premature reversal signals

**Fix Strategy:**
- Change thresholds to 30/70 to align with SMC standards
- Update both hybrid logic (lines 1285, 1305) and rejection logic (lines 1958, 1963)
- Consistent with institutional reversal requirements

**Files to Modify:**
- `api/smc_analyzer.py` lines 1285, 1305, 1958, 1963

**Status:** ‚è≥ Pending

---

### ‚úÖ Issue 5: ATR Filter Placement Inefficiency
**Severity:** Low  
**Location:** `api/smc_analyzer.py` lines 1757-1820

**Problem:**
- Auto-volatility detection (lines 1757-1802) runs BEFORE ATR filter (lines 1807-1820)
- If ATR filter rejects, volatility tuning was wasted computation
- Low volatility triggers parameter adjustments that are then unused

**Fix Strategy:**
- Move ATR filter check to BEFORE volatility detection
- Only tune parameters if trade passes ATR filter
- Saves computation on rejected trades

**Files to Modify:**
- `api/smc_analyzer.py` lines 1757-1820 (reorder logic)

**Status:** ‚è≥ Pending

---

### ‚úÖ Issue 6: 15m Alignment Score Missing Data Logic
**Severity:** Medium  
**Location:** `api/smc_analyzer.py` lines 1866-1870, 1983-1986

**Problem:**
- Missing 15m data = 0.5 alignment score (passes)
- Conflicting 15m data (score 0.2) = rejection
- Missing data treated better than poor quality data

**Fix Strategy:**
- Use lower confidence multiplier when 15m data missing
- Reduce alignment score to 0.3 for missing data (borderline)
- Ensures "no information" is not better than "negative information"

**Files to Modify:**
- `api/smc_analyzer.py` lines 1983-1986

**Status:** ‚è≥ Pending
