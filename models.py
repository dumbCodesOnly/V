# This bot uses in-memory storage, so no database models are needed currently

# Import required modules for potential future use

# Note: This app doesn't use SQLAlchemy/database models yet
# All data is stored in-memory within the Flask app
# If database integration is needed in the future, 
# SQLAlchemy models can be added here
