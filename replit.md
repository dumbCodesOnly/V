# Multi-Exchange Trading Bot

## Recent Changes

### October 5, 2025 - SMC Bug Fixes & Code Cleanup
- **🐛 Critical Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed swing point KeyError: Changed dict key access from "price" to "low"/"high" in `_get_execution_signal_15m()`
  - Fixed stop loss validation: Added pre-validation to ensure SL doesn't exceed entry price in edge cases (both long/short)
  - Fixed order block entry logic: Changed to use current_price when already inside OB zone for immediate entry
  - Fixed liquidity pool inconsistency: Changed hardcoded -5 to use `SMCConfig.RECENT_SWING_LOOKBACK`
- **🧹 Code Cleanup**:
  - Removed 3 unused duplicate methods: `_calculate_long_prices()`, `_calculate_short_prices()`, `generate_enhanced_signal()`
  - Standardized ATR floor comments to "0.1% minimum ATR" across all instances
  - Moved volatility regime adjustment BEFORE ATR filter for consistent parameter application
- **✅ Verified FVG gap logic as correct** - no changes needed
- **📚 Updated Documentation**: Added comprehensive "Known Issues & Fixes" section to SMC_ANALYZER_DOCUMENTATION.md

### October 5, 2025 - SMC Documentation Consolidated & Logic Fixes
- **📚 Consolidated Documentation**: All SMC docs merged into `/SMC_ANALYZER_DOCUMENTATION.md`
  - Archived 6 old documents to `docs/archive/` for historical reference
  - Single source of truth for SMC features, configuration, and usage
- **Fixed Type Safety**: Added `@overload` decorators to `generate_trade_signal()` method, reducing LSP errors from 117 to 49
- **Fixed Counter-Trend Logic**: Removed duplicate RSI/sweep validation to eliminate conflicting rejection reasons
- **Fixed Confidence Scoring**: Eliminated triple-counting of bonuses - now Phase 3 is single source of truth
- **Updated RSI Thresholds**: Changed from 35/65 to 30/70 to align with SMC standards
- **Optimized ATR Filter**: Moved volatility check BEFORE parameter tuning to save computation
- **Improved 15m Data Handling**: Changed missing data default from 0.5 (neutral) to 0.3 (borderline) for better risk assessment

## Overview
This project is a Telegram-based trading bot designed for USDT-M futures trading across Toobit and LBank exchanges. It allows users to manage multiple trading configurations conversationally through Telegram, offering advanced risk management, portfolio tracking, and real-time execution monitoring. The goal is to provide a powerful, user-friendly tool for active traders, leveraging Telegram for accessibility, with modular exchange support and a comprehensive suite of trading tools. The bot aims to be a robust solution for managing and automating trading strategies across multiple platforms.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
The application uses Flask for the Telegram Mini-App interface and webhook integration. A `MultiTradeManager` orchestrates concurrent `TradingBot` instances, ensuring user isolation for multiple trading configurations.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
The UI/UX features a dark blue theme with gradient backgrounds, high-contrast white text, and vibrant blue accents, optimized for mobile with responsive design. It uses professional trading platform symbols and typography from Google Fonts (Inter for text, JetBrains Mono for numerical data), with "Trading Expert" as the application title.

**Technical Implementations & Feature Specifications:**
- Streamlined project structure with clear environment separation and an `api/` directory.

- **Multi-Timeframe SMC Analysis** (All 7 Phases Complete - October 2025):
  - **📚 Complete Documentation: See `/SMC_ANALYZER_DOCUMENTATION.md`**
  - Institutional-grade top-down analysis across 4 timeframes (1d → 4h/1h → 15m execution)
  - HTF bias determination from Daily and H4 structure
  - Intermediate structure analysis on H4/H1 (Order Blocks, FVGs, BOS/CHoCH)
  - 15m execution signals with HTF alignment validation
  - Enhanced confidence scoring with multi-timeframe alignment bonuses
  - Scaling entry strategy: 50% market + 25% + 25% limit orders at OB/FVG zones
  - Refined stop-loss using 15m swing levels + ATR buffers
  - R:R-based take profits (1R, 2R, liquidity targets) with 40/30/30 allocation
  - ATR risk filter rejecting low-volatility choppy conditions (0.8% min on 15m, 1.2% min on H1)
  - Optional dynamic position sizing based on ATR volatility
  - SMC signals correctly displayed and cached in the database with validation
  - Recent fixes (Oct 5, 2025): Type safety, confidence scoring, RSI thresholds, ATR optimization

**System Design Choices:**
The system features a modular design with `TradeConfig` objects encapsulating parameters and `TradingBot` instances handling execution and state. Position management supports partial closing, and risk management includes breakeven stop loss and trailing stop. `PortfolioTracker` offers comprehensive analytics, including multi-user support and detailed trade history. Data management uses in-memory, dictionary-based structures for user data isolation, trade configuration persistence, and session management. API credentials are encrypted.
