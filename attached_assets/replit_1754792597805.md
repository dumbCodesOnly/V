## System Architecture

### Flask Web Application
The application uses Flask as the primary web framework serving multiple purposes:
- **Webhook Integration**: Processes Telegram bot updates via `/webhook` endpoint for real-time message handling with comprehensive validation
- **Health Monitoring**: Provides `/health` endpoint for external uptime monitoring services
- **Web Dashboard**: Serves an HTML interface showing real-time bot status, statistics, and active trades with Bootstrap styling and gradient backgrounds

The Flask app maintains a single TelegramBot instance that orchestrates all user interactions through dependency injection.

### Multi-Trade Management System
The core architectural innovation centers around the MultiTradeManager class enabling concurrent trade management:
- **User Isolation**: Each Telegram user maintains multiple independent trading configurations using chat_id-based separation
- **Trade Selection**: Users can switch between different trade setups using a selection system with unique trade IDs
- **Bot Orchestration**: Manages multiple TradingBot instances running concurrently for different trades
- **State Management**: Tracks user selections and maintains trade configuration state across sessions

### Trading Engine Architecture
The trading system follows a modular design pattern with clear separation of concerns:
- **TradeConfig**: Configuration objects containing all trade parameters including symbol, entry/exit prices, three-level take profit system, leverage, and position sizing percentages
- **TradingBot**: Individual bot instances that execute trades with state tracking for entry fills, take profit levels, stop loss management, and trailing stop functionality
- **Position Management**: Supports partial position closing at different take profit levels with configurable size percentages
- **Risk Management**: Implements breakeven stop loss movement and trailing stop activation based on profit thresholds

### Portfolio Management
The PortfolioTracker provides comprehensive analytics and trade history:
- **Multi-User Support**: Maintains separate portfolio data for each Telegram user with defaultdict initialization
- **Trade History**: Records detailed trade events, executions, and P&L calculations with timestamps
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks win/loss ratios, realized/unrealized P&L, and symbol-specific performance statistics
- **Daily Analytics**: Maintains daily P&L tracking and performance summaries

### Telegram Bot Integration
The bot uses webhook-based communication with the Telegram Bot API:
- **Message Processing**: Handles both direct messages and callback queries from inline keyboards
- **HTML Formatting**: Rich text display with HTML parsing for enhanced user interface
- **Interactive Menus**: Provides keyboard-based navigation for trade configuration and management
- **Real-time Updates**: Sends trade execution notifications and status updates to users
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and timeout management for API requests

### Data Management
The system uses in-memory data structures for session management:
- **Dictionary-based Storage**: User data organized by chat_id with nested structures for trades and configurations
- **State Persistence**: Maintains trading state across webhook calls without external database dependencies
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Provides backward compatibility properties for single-trade workflows
- **UUID Generation**: Uses short UUID prefixes for user-friendly trade identification
