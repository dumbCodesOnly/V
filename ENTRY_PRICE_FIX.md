# Entry Price Display Fix

## Problem
Entry prices were not showing up in position information on Vercel deployment due to missing or incomplete entry price data during trade execution.

## Root Cause
The `get_live_market_price` function had duplicate code and wasn't reliably fetching live prices during trade execution, causing entry_price to remain null/undefined.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed get_live_market_price Function
- Updated to use multi-source API approach (CoinGecko → Binance)
- Removed duplicate code that was causing confusion
- Added proper error handling with fallback pricing
- Ensures reliable price fetching for trade execution

### 2. Trade Execution Flow
During trade execution (`/api/execute-trade`):
- Market orders: `entry_price` = live market price from `get_live_market_price()`
- Limit orders: `entry_price` = specified limit price
- Both are properly set in the trade configuration

### 3. Frontend Display
The frontend JavaScript correctly displays entry prices:
- Positions tab: Shows `pos.entry_price` 
- Trading tab: Shows `trade.entry_price`

## API Data Flow
1. User executes trade → `/api/execute-trade`
2. Function calls `get_live_market_price()` for market orders
3. Sets `config.entry_price` and `config.current_price`
4. Frontend fetches via `/api/user-trades` and displays entry price

## For Vercel Deployment
Copy the updated `api/app.py` to ensure the fixed `get_live_market_price` function is included in the Vercel deployment.

## Expected Result
Entry prices will now display correctly in both positions and trading tabs showing the actual execution price (e.g., "$119,453.61") instead of "Market" or empty values.
