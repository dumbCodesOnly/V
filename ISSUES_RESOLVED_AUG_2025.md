# Issues Resolved - August 2025

## API Endpoint Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Missing Health Endpoint

- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Both endpoints now work

### 2. Missing Positions Endpoint

## Telegram WebApp Compatibility Fixed ✅

### 4. ShowPopup Method Error
- **Issue**: `[Telegram.WebApp] Method showPopup is not supported in version 6.0`
- **Solution**: Added compatibility layer that falls back to `showAlert` for older versions
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - No more showPopup errors in console

### 5. Enhanced Fallback System

- **Solution**: Improved fallback with proper method detection and graceful degradation
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Works in all Telegram versions and standalone testing

## Import and Deployment Consistency Fixed ✅

### 6. Dual Import Strategy

- **Solution**: Implemented try/except import strategy in `api/app.py`
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Works in both environments

### 7. Workflow Compatibility
- **Issue**: Telegram Trading Bot workflow failing due to import issues
- **Solution**: Created `app.py` entry point for workflow compatibility

## Testing Results ✅
